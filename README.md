# Compare Best Brokers

## Overview
This is a full-stack web application built to compare and display broker information in a clear and user-friendly way.  
It connects a **React frontend** with a **.NET Web API backend**, making it both functional and scalable.  
The goal is to provide users with quick insights, while also showcasing my ability to build and structure a complete project.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Create React App)  
- **Styling**: CSS  
- **Backend**: .NET Web API  
- **Database**: SQL Server / MySQL  
- **Other**: Custom services, hooks, and utilities for clean project structure  

## How it works
1. User interacts with the React frontend.  
2. Frontend sends requests to the backend API.  
3. Backend (built with .NET) applies business logic and queries the database.  
4. Data is sent back and displayed in the UI.  

## Project Structure
- **/assets** → images, icons, static files  
- **/services** → API requests  
- **/store** → state management  
- **/utils** → helper functions  
- **/components** → reusable UI blocks  
- **/pages** → main app pages  

## Purpose
The app was built to be **practical and usable**, not just a demo.  
It demonstrates:  
- A working connection between React and .NET Web API  
- Clean, modular code organization  
- A responsive and user-focused design  
- My ability to deliver a real-world portfolio project  

## Getting Started
Frontend:
```bash
npm install
npm start
